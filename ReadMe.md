#### Q2. Please briefly describe your algorithm and why you think it's optimal. If you had multiple solutions in mind, why did you choose this particular one?
I used the Dynamic Programming.
There are a lot of solutions to solve this problem.
But, It needs the optimized time, so to solve the time complexity and to run faster, so I used the Dynamic Programming.
